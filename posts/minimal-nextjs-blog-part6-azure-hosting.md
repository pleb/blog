*This is a multipart series. If you haven't read the previous post, I'd suggest you start at [part 1](/posts/minimal-nextjs-blog-part1-hello-world), as all subsequent parts continue on from each other and likely won't make sense as individual units.*

Part 6, Welcome. In this part, I'll be setting up hosting on Azure. I'll be making use of [Static Web Apps (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview).

Initially, I planned to use the static hosting via [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) & Azure CDN. However, Static Web Apps caught my eye, and wow, does it make this part easy - as you will see.

## Next.Js Static HTML

Next.Js supports exporting an app to static HTML, which was my plan on how I was going to use it. As per the Next.Js [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) "The exported app supports almost every feature of Next.js, including dynamic routes, prefetching, preloading and dynamic imports.". To enable this, I slightly tweak the build script command in the `package.json` file and add a call to export.

I change the build task from:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build
}
```

to:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build && next export"
}
```

When I run the `build` command, now

```ps
npm run build
```

Next.js outputs a static website in the generated `/out` directory.

Another great feature is the size of the payload. Keep in mind, that my site does not have any styling whatsoever. However, when I view the network tab, I see the following figures:

0 requests
82.6 kB transferred
195 kB resources

As you can imagine, the site loads fast (AU -> US West). About 1 second without cache and about 1/4 of a second with cache.

Nice üëç

## Static Web Apps

Thankfully, setting up a Static Web App was surprisingly easy as per the Azure norm. I won't lie; my first go ended in an error that came down to me entering `/out` as the path to collect the Github actions artifact instead of `out` without the leading slash. Everything else, though, just worked. WOW!

To create the Static Web App, I used the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) interface.

Then I entered details as requested by Azure for this site. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Lucky for me, Static Web Apps will integrate with Github using [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and again fortunately for me, it will sort all of this out without me doing anything ü§Ø. I simply allowed Azure access to my Github data via an authorised OAuth App, and üí•

Next, I entered the build information, ensuring I entered `out` without a leading slash as the `App artifact location`. I also cleared the `Api location` as I won't be using a backend. However, this option is for wiring up a backend using the [Azure functions (serverless)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/functions), which I found interesting ü§î.

I skipped over the creation of the tag as I don't need them. Maybe one day...

The review and create screen is a summary screen. With everything looking in order, I hit create.

I then get redirected to the overview screen.

Once the deployment is complete, I see that Azure has added the file needed for the Github Action when I look in my repo.

When I go and view the actions, I see that a job has been queued.

After a few minutes, I get an email saying my site is ready... It is üéâ.

See, I told you it was easy. The best part is that whenever I commit to the main branch, the Github Action will run and publish the new version to my Azure Static Web App. I was even able to point a custom domain to it and surprisingly, an SSL cert came included too.

But wait! There's more. When I make a PR in Github to the main branch, guess what? The friendly github-actions bot deploys a staging site with the changes from my PR ü§Ø.

In [part 7](/posts/minimal-nextjs-blog-part6-react-components) I'll be updating the UI getting it ready for styling. Like this part, it's going to be amazing (Again, Self Certified).
